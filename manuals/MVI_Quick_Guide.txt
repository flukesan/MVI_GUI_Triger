# MVI Edge Inspection Quick Guide

## Overview
MVI (Maximo Visual Inspection) Edge is an AI-powered visual inspection system for manufacturing quality control.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation
- Install MVI Edge Server
- Configure camera connections
- Upload trained models

### 2. Configuration

#### Detection Threshold
- Navigate to: Models > [Model Name] > Settings
- Adjust Detection Threshold (0.0-1.0)
- Higher threshold = fewer false positives
- Lower threshold = better detection but more false positives
- Recommended: 0.7-0.8 for most cases

#### Camera Setup
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher recommended
- Frame rate: 30 FPS minimum
- Lighting: Even, diffused lighting works best
- Distance: Depends on object size and lens

### 3. MQTT Configuration
- Broker: localhost or remote server
- Port: 1883 (default) or 8883 (TLS)
- QoS: 1 recommended
- Topics:
  - Trigger: mvi/{device}/trigger
  - Result: mvi/{device}/result

## Common Issues

### Issue: High false positive rate
Solution:
1. Increase detection threshold
2. Improve lighting conditions
3. Retrain model with more data
4. Check camera focus

### Issue: Missing defects
Solution:
1. Lower detection threshold
2. Check lighting (shadows can hide defects)
3. Verify model includes this defect type
4. Add more training images

### Issue: MQTT connection drops
Solution:
1. Check network stability
2. Increase keep-alive interval
3. Use QoS 1 or 2
4. Verify firewall settings

## Best Practices

### Training Data
- Minimum 50-100 images per defect type
- Include variations in lighting, angles, positions
- Balance pass/fail ratio
- Label carefully and consistently

### Inspection Setup
- Fixed camera position
- Consistent lighting
- Clean camera lens regularly
- Calibrate camera if needed

### Performance
- Use GPU for faster inference
- Optimize image resolution
- Process images sequentially
- Monitor CPU/GPU usage
